# ep_standups
Etherpad lite plugin to generate a daily or weekly group standup pad with the date in the name

http://someetherpad.com/weekly/\<group\>   => `/p/\<group\>-\<year\>-\<month\>-\<day\>` (date of the Monday of the current week)

Pads are created blank or from a default PAD `<group>-default`
